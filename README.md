trial by code and not with my A Game

Things that are either being worked on or need to be worked on:

### on the custom form template file the code needs splitting up into respective parts and saved into their own files before calling them in with require_once or include statements

### wp_register... and wp_enqueue... for stylesheets and javascript

### finish spliting up the main index.php into respective templates for use with get_header() get_footer() the_title() the_excerpt() etc....

### add display of the data once I get it successfully submitting to the database

### pagination needs to be added to the displayed data or lazy load with a set number triggered with each scroll

### function.php needs to be finished to include all various theme support required/desired
